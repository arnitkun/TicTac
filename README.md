# TicTac : Player versus Player Tic-Tac-Toe

To See a demo of the app go to : https://ticotac.herokuapp.com/


**Installation :**

1. To play in your browser go to : https://ticotac.herokuapp.com/ OR
2. Clone the repository.
3. Open the tic-tac-toe.html file from the root directory of the repository.

**Gameplay :**

1. The game asks for the name of both players, not putting in the name as well as deleting the preset "player_1" or "player_2"
   text names the respective players "player_1" or "player_2" repectively. Same is the case if one "cancels" the dialog box asking for        player name.
2. The first player to enter his/her name is "X" while the second player is "O".
3. The first probability of a player getting to move first is randomized.
3. A reset button exists to restart the game, allowing for new players to play. This resets the playernames and therefore the scores.
4. To play again, one of the players can press the "Play Again!" button to start a fresh new game. The scores remain until the browser is    closed, refreshed or the reset button is pressed.
4. Once a player wins, his/her score is increased by one and the winning combination lights up in green on the board.
5. The game will tell if a match is draw or if someone wins and, updates the scores.
